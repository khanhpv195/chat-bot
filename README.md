# Chatbot Project

This project aims to develop a comprehensive chatbot system that integrates both frontend and backend technologies to provide a seamless user experience.

## Frontend

The frontend of the chatbot is built using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes popular libraries and frameworks like React or Angular to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. The frontend is responsible for handling user input, displaying chatbot responses, and managing the overall user interface.

## Backend

The backend of the chatbot is built using a robust programming language like Node.js or Python. It leverages popular frameworks like Express.js or Django to handle incoming requests, process user input, and generate responses. The backend is responsible for integrating with natural language processing (NLP) services, managing user sessions, and storing chatbot data.
